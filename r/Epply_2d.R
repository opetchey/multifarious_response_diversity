#' Epply functional response curve with 2 environmental factors, with potential interaction
#' effect between the two environmental factors.
#' 
#' Parameters are given in a list, and are:
#' $z$ controls location of maximum.
#' $w$ controls range of $E$ over which the rate is positive.
#' $a$ scaling constant.
#' $b$ controls rate of increase towards the maximum rate, as $E$ increases.
#' $zint$ interaction effect on location of maximum
#' $sd_rate$ is the standard deviation of the noise that is added to the rate
#'
#' @param E1 Value of environmental factor 1
#' @param E2 Value of environmental factor 2
#' @param pars A list of parameters
#' @return The calculated rate
#' @export
